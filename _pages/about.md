I am a PhD student studying observational and theoretical astrophysics at UCLA. For my research, I use telescope data and computer simulations to turn back time and uncover the histories of planets and how they came to be. I'm also passionate about teaching and outreach as a path towards equity and opportunity in STEM.

**Dynamical Origins of Kepler-1656b**
Highly eccentric exoplanet orbits are often a smoking gun for a tumultuous dynamical history. One planet of particular interest is Kepler-1656b, the most eccentric orbit for any planet <100 Earth masses known to date. My current project aims to understand the dynamical events that led to such an eccentric orbit.

**Demographics of Protoplanetary Disks**
Direct imaging of highly inclined protoplanetary disks can offer unique information about planet formation and disk structure. Unfortunately, such systems are rarely detectable, leaving us with a small sample size. To understand the broader implications of our limited sample, we simulate thousands of protoplanetary disks to uncover detection bias and determine “edge-on” disk occurrence rates.

**A Case for an Atmosphere on 55 Cancri e**
One of the major surprises exoplanet scientists have uncovered is a wealth of planets called “Super-Earths”, which are unlike any of the planets in our Solar System. Consequently, we are interested in studying Super-Earths to understand how they fit into the big picture. For my research, I used photometric data one such planet, 55 Cancri e, to place constraints on the planet’s composition and make a case for a thick atmosphere.

**Discovery of “Exo-Venus” Kepler-1649b**
Earth and Venus are similar in many ways, but somehow Venus ended up with a much less habitable environment. To understand how this happened, we can study the properties of planets Venus analogs (or “exo-Venuses”) to learn how they evolve. Kepler-1649b is one such planet, similar in size to Earth but orbiting just inside it’s host star’s habitable zone.
