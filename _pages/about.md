I am a PhD student studying observational and theoretical astrophysics at UCLA. For my research, I use telescope data and computer simulations to turn back time and uncover the histories of planets and how they came to be. I'm also passionate about teaching and outreach as a path towards equity and opportunity in STEM.

Research
======

Dynamical Origins of Kepler-1656b
------
Highly eccentric exoplanet orbits are often a smoking gun for a tumultuous dynamical history. One planet of particular interest is Kepler-1656b, the most eccentric orbit for any planet <100 Earth masses known to date. My current project aims to understand the dynamical events that led to such an eccentric orbit.

Demographics of Protoplanetary Disks
------
Direct imaging of highly inclined protoplanetary disks can offer unique information about planet formation and disk structure. Unfortunately, such systems are rarely detectable, leaving us with a small sample size. To understand the broader implications of our limited sample, we simulate thousands of protoplanetary disks to uncover detection bias and determine “edge-on” disk occurrence rates.

A Case for an Atmosphere on 55 Cancri e
------
One of the major surprises exoplanet scientists have uncovered is a wealth of planets called “Super-Earths”, which are unlike any of the planets in our Solar System. Consequently, we are interested in studying Super-Earths to understand how they fit into the big picture. For my research, I used photometric data one such planet, 55 Cancri e, to place constraints on the planet’s composition and make a case for a thick atmosphere.

Discovery of “Exo-Venus” Kepler-1649b
------
Earth and Venus are similar in many ways, but somehow Venus ended up with a much less habitable environment. To understand how this happened, we can study the properties of planets Venus analogs (or “exo-Venuses”) to learn how they evolve. Kepler-1649b is one such planet, similar in size to Earth but orbiting just inside it’s host star’s habitable zone.

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
